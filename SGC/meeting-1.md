# Cast team SGC

## Stop
 - Having more than one PO discussing user stories at the end
 - The insanity of booking tickets on the last day and having thirty thousand things go wrong - I would rather book the tickets myself and be reimbursed...+1 + :heart: :joy:
 - Going through *every* crazy 8 idea. Not sure how we would decide which to look at though

## Go
* Spend time at the end of crazy 8's, after voting, to discuss the __final__ idea :+1:  :+1: 
    * & less time initially going through them 
* Finding out where the design days are more in advance..?
* Trying to get more simple apps: they are too big for a 3build day sprint :raised_hands:
* Write examples for each design challenge following a unified theme (for instance, an AirBNB-ish app)
* 
* Chatting to Ellie directly on Slack so that we dont have a wierd communication chain  :+1: :+1::+1:
* Have you guys involved in running the workshops? if you want to. :+1: especially when Ivan is leaving us in december!!
* writing stuff on the github projects - does it work at all? Noga was the only one that wrote anything! maybe its not needed..?
* Try to get to the design workshop slightly early to avoid technical hiccups re: projectors (Didn't start till 10:45 on monday)
* start thinking about who would like to continue with the two weeks build sprints, ideally all of you! but I think we should start planning this out and ask for clarity about it from ellie/charities.

## Continue
* __*Awesome*__ design support :+1: :sunglasses: +2
* amazing work on those mockups/prototypes!
* Accommodations booked
* Scottish urban living
* Presentations preparations
* Help across teams
