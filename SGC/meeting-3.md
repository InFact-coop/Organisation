Should the product be something we can build in a 2 week sprint or a fully fledged app/ proof of concept.

Additions by Mavis:

- What went well
    - Rapid build/boiler plates - we built 10 pretty functional prototypes!
    - Making the HackMd's/readmes are good case studies
    - Having designs to work towards helped build something more visually impressive to clients
    - Having Ivan/Andrew as techinical support was super helpful and made more sense than traditional QA's
- What didn't go well
    - Not knowing exactly what the charitie's knew/ had planned - understandably this is v. diff for each charity but sometimes I found it uncomfortable, as it felt like we accidentally offered something that will be hard to deliver?
    - Hectic schedule kind of worked, but all the overlapping/context switching made it hard to completely get focused. Also made it difficult re: having designs early in the build
    - I don't think spreading the project management aspect around everyone worked _super_ well, but maybe that's just me
    - Slight lack of clarity in everyone's roles (kind of relates to the point above)
    - Often didn't come out of the workshop with a clear idea of what we were building/what the flow would be

- Noga: where do we double up?
- Ava are going in for Comic relief with us as partners, with £5500 for the sprint
- Max: Is that standard
- Noga: Not really a standard breaks down as senior: £200/day Junior: £150-170/day
- Noga: Ellie wants someone from the original team on each build
- Mavis: who's on devon air ambulance?
- Noga: Max/aisha one of mavis/jen. Mavis on Unlock, Jen on Devon air ambulance?
- Dan: lets come up with a modus operandi and share with everyone and then discuss it
 #### AP
- [ ] Dan and noga to come up with a proposal on budget and how it should be split and eligibility for who gets what project. Another call Wednesday at 2pm.

### What was the aim of the design sprint?
- In the design sprint what are we building? A protottype of what we could build in the two weeks, or a prototype of a fully fledged app?
- depends on the clients, probably more a prototype of the fully fledged app?
- Are we clear on that?
- clients always wanna push, normal part of the process
- we definitely say it in the design day
- we could maybe be more clear
- Dan: The design sprint should be something we think we could do in 2 weeks and should be careful about what we promise, be very clear
- Noga: Some
- Times the problem can't be solved in a 2 week build though
- Max: learning process?


Rebe's inputs:

Agree with most of the menitoned above.
Maybe something is missing is: Was Elm the right technology for these projects? I am very happy to have learned it but maybe for the next build of prototypes, this should be reassessed.

I felt sometimes our interests were not taken into consideration that much: Compromising ourselves for the designs and the build sprints without knowing when that will start and if they will start.

- Andrew: people are impressed by the high fidelity of using coded prototypes as opposed to just designs

### Stops

- Don't let PO's get carried
- Scoping too large an idea
- Being asked to do more work/not having tickets bought in advance
- Disputing design decisions. Needs good timing


### Continue

- User testing role play was good. Should extend this to happening on day 5. Possibly with fake users
- Keeping the energy up

#### AP

- [ ] Continue the readme's
- 


### Go

- FAC11 were less aware to take initiative. Take more initiative? 
 #### AP
- [ ] Have team meeting at the start before any coding happens
    - clarifying our relationships to CAST and CAST to charities and Us to charities

 #### AP
- Potential Schedule:
    - Day 1: Design day
    - Day 2: Dev and desigin talk about the flow then both get started
    - Day 3-4: Build
    - Day 5: Finish build, arrange sprint review to happen in the afternoon. Potentially include a sprint planning here. Possibly include usertesting

 #### AP
- [ ] Can keep Ellie in the loop for the builds, but just out of politeness
- [ ] Clarify the handover process with everyone
- [ ] Conversation menu

- Clarifying the build sprint scope
- Sprint planning meeting should include a senior dev

- When does scoping happen? In Sprint planning? Some of the project might go on for longer than 2 weeks we need to be clear about that?
- Contract will be sent to clients before the start of the build?
- Team composition will depend on personnel could be 1 'junior'/1 'senior' or 2 'junior'
