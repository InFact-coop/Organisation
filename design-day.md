## Checklist for setting up with PO's

- [] Turn on their web notifications
- [] Get them to write user stories under issues
- [] Explain that you will @ them for more info, and that they will get a notification. If possible model this process with info that is needed
- [] Show them the `technical` lable and say they can ignore anything with this
